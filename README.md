This model is demonstration of the process followed for the calibration of a sensor, part of a research article I'm collaborationg in.

the piece ´modelo_placa_sensor_ diseño6_ v7.2.0 v005´ is not of my autoship. It was designed by __ and I adapted my designs to work around it. This model´s highlight is the wedge designed for the wooden box to stay still while giving the sensor two different tilted positions for data points to be obtained.
